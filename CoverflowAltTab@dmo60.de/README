CoverflowAltTab
=================

CoverflowAltTab is an extension for Cinnamon (http://cinnamon.linuxmint.com/).

It let's you Alt-Tab through your windows in a cover-flow manner.

This is only a 1:1 port of the CoverflowAltTab extension for Gnome-Shell from http://code.google.com/p/gnome-shell-extensions-coverflowalttab/, so all credits to the original author!

 

Installation
================

	1) Copy the folder "CoverflowAltTab@dmo60.de" to "~/.local/share/cinnamon/extensions/".
	
	2) Enable the extension in cinnamon settings. (Eventually you have to restart cinnamon: Press Alt+F2, type 'r' and enter)



Usage
===============

There are several "Switch xxx" under "Settings => Keyboard => Shortcuts => Navigation", this extensions replace a few of them:
  - "Switch applications": cycle through windows from all workspaces
  - "Switch windows of an application": cycle through windows from current
    workspace
  - "Switch system controls": cycle through windows from the same application
    across all workspaces (who wants to cycle through system controls anyway?)
All of the shortcuts with "Shift" key pressed cycles backward.

Hit "Esc" during cycling to cancel.
Hit "q"  during cycling to close highlighted window.
